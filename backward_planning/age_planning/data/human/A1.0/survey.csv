7,23,Female,Part-time,USA,2,"The first and second steps had the smallest numbers, so I didn't want to waste my $1 on clicking those.","The last steps had the bigger numbers and I wanted to know which step had 48, so I only clicked on the last steps.",I was most likely to click on the right wing of either last step.,I stop clicking when I saw 48.,I just clicked on the last steps and tried my best to guess where 48 might be.,No.,I don't think I learned anything.

9,20,Male,Part-time,USA,3,"first two nodes are low value, so not worth clicking as there are 6 nodes total (for the first two steps) for a $6 cost to open them. And just blindly picking one towards the greatest last node value would lose less money.","last node gave largest value, so clicked that",last node,when i got 48 in last node,"click last node --> find largest number --> if largest is 24, click on 2nd node",no,how to do math?,"interesting study, really enjoyed it as opposed to the mindless HITs that we normally do."
