32,19,Female,full-time university student,USA,4,"I decided I wouldn't click on any nodes along the way, as the ""end nodes"" had the most value.","I clicked on the ""end nodes"", knowing that there were only four of them and that would be the most economical way to determine where there would be a positive monetary value.","I was most likely to click on the leftmost ""end nodes"".","I stopped clicking either when I saw a positive monetary value or the largest positive value possible, 48 (depending on how much money I had that round)",,At first I was confused about the directions in which the spider could move.,I learned that I'm not as strategic as I thought I was (it took me quite a few rounds to develop a strategy).,

36,19,Male,Employed part-time,United States of America,4,If the 48 was already found,The final ones to see which one held the highest amount,top right,When I found the 48 or best route,Just aim for 48 no matter the path,No,Get through smaller hits to pay for the bigger amount of 48.,Most fun survey I have had thus far
37,58,female,Employed Full Time,United States,3,"If I found the positive highest amount on the last node, I didn't click anymore.",I decided that the last nodes were the most important since they held the highest values.,On one of the outermost nodes. ,"If I found the positive highest amount on the last node, I didn't click anymore because I didn't feel like I needed to.",I just tried to find the highest positive value and head towards it.,No,"I learned that it was important to find the highest positive value in the outer nodes, even if it meant spending money to do so.

41,22,Male,Student,USA,2,Same logic as why I did,Lowest cost and seeing a pattern,Yes?,When I got to a stop point,Once I saw a 48 I just went to it because the path to it couldn't be worse,N/A,N/A,Neat task!

44,21,Female ,Part-time,United States,3,I did not click towards a path where I saw only negative values ,I clicked on the higher paying nodes first and then depending on where the 48 value ones were I clicked on the path that lead there.,The highest value nodes,When a path with an end node of 48 with the least amount of negatives in the path appeared ,None,None,I learned we come up with strategies especially when money is at stake.,Very fun and interesting
