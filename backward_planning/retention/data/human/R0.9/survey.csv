2,,No.,To wait for the first high paying result and then go.,No.,56
3,I found this to be easy to understand.,It is so difficult to make a decision without knowing the outcome.,I love this game!,38,kathleenshea1011@gmail.com

5,No,The most efficient way to find the best nodes was to find one that was moderately high before revealing more and then just moving in to that one,This is a fun stand-alone game even as not part of a study! Kind of like minesweeper,28,nuclearsex@gmail.com
6,no,I learned to check first,,34,albeauchampmturk@gmail.com
7,No,"It's generally not worth checking any spots but the end points. There was a huge range in value of the end points only. The end points varied so much that it was worth paying out to check most/all of them, even though sometimes I wasted some money checking them. ",,31,natyergin@gmail.com
8,aosotsi@gmail.com,"Nope, I mastered this :).","Start at the edges, if you find a good number, just go there.",GREAT survey and GOOD GAME!,29
9,No,I wouldn't say that this is a new concept to me - but it was definitely a good exercise in cost/benefit analysis.,NA,30,straina@alumni.nd.edu

14,not this time,I learned to actually read the instruction carefully,,26,nat090921@gmail.com
15,,,,,
16,fuctone@hotmail.com,not knowing what the max points available although i took that as part of the game,It was a good exercise in problem solving. Figuring out the best cost vs benefit ratio of what to pay to uncover,fun game. thanks,40
17,runnerlori@yahoo.com,no,I learned that I needed to spend the money to reveal the final landing spot. I had to use the strategy or I lost each time.,I loved driving my spider. It is hypnotic and I would do it for free!,49

19,weitz01@yahoo.com,No,How to judge the best route based on a few points.,No,33
20,It was relatively straightforward and I had fun playing the game because I was earning real money.,I cost of $1 to see what was under a node added up very quickly and I used it less as the rounds went on.,no,22,matthewcarusillo@gmail.com
21,No,To not reveal too many spots or I'll waste money,That was fun!,38,amanda.hewitt@gmail.com
22,tree9933@yahoo.com,I didn't understand about the ability to peek at the amount before choosing a direction during the first round. ,Patience and willingness to lose something to gain something.,Fun and interesting,55

30,No,Someones you need to check all routes before making a final decision. There are some roads that you will end up losing too much before the final destination,Interesting game.,34,steven.s.lee@gmail.com

46,jpayne0810@gmail.com,no,That I could check the nodes for one dollar and decide which way to move. ,"was fun, thanks",45
47,"no, this game is great! well done! I hope to read your paper on this in the future. ","when there's only one choice, don't waste money on revealing the score, also, I gambled when I already clicked on a big number, I will forgot knowing the other numbers and just go with the big one.save me a couple bucks","no, great job making this game, and the survey in general, it's a subtle art making surveys engaging and remain retention rate.! well done.

48,Nope,Making sure I uncovered enough final nodes was key.,Nope. Have a nice day.,40,bigtime665@msn.com
49,digmydreams@gmail.com,"No, it was all explained very clearly","The spaces closest to the starting point wouldn't impact the score much, if at all. It's a waste of $1 to click on those.",That was so much fun! Thank you!,32

56,no,I learned that clicking on multiple circles yields better results,,32,
57,Yes. At first I thought that the node inspector could only be used on the nodes immediately adjacent to the starting node. It wasn't until near the end that I realized you could inspect any node before moving.,I learned how to play a game.,,33,paulmrodriguez@gmail.com
