The total base payment for both HITs is $2.00.</p>

<p>Stage 1 takes about 5 minutes. It pays only  $0.10 but you can earn a performance-dependent but it makes you eligible
to participate in Stage 2 where you can earn $1.90 in 10 minutes plus a performance-dependent
bonus of up to $3.50 ($1.30 is a typical bonus). 
You will complete Stage 2 in a second HIT which you can begin <b>tomorrow
between 12:41 PM
and 12:41 AM</b>.
If you do not begin the HIT within this time frame, you will not receive the
second base payment or any bonus.           </p>

<p>By completing both stages, you can make up to
$5.50, but if you don't complete Stage 2, you will lose your bonus from Stage 1 and the HIT would be a very bad deal for you.</p>
