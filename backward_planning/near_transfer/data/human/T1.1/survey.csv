0,Not clicking withing the trail,Clicking on the end of the trails,the end of the trails.,When I saw a high number,n/a,,To not be greedy and to stop sometimes sooner when I saw a high number. ,,47
1,I did not go in the direction of low nodes,I started with the farthest nodes and found the highest value,I started with the outside nodes in random order,I stopped clicking when I found a value close to 50,I simply clicked outside nodes until I was satisfied with a value.,It was easy,I learned how to optimize my path,,23
2,"The earlier nodes had very little value and also very little loss, so it wasn't worth clicking the earlier nodes.","I decided to click the end points, since those seemed to have the largest payouts.",The nodes at the end of the paths.,"I thought about stopping if I had a value of 40 or higher, as the odds of me making more than I spent beyond that seemed somewhat low. But I was curious and still clicked the final end-point nodes.","I started the first 5 rounds by clicking every node, and essentially gathering data. After that I determined that the final node points where the highest priority. If two node points with the highest values on different paths had similar values, it seemed best to check the node directly before them to decide which path, and save money by not clicking any other nodes.",It was easy to understand after the practice rounds.,I learned that I should have adapted my strategy much sooner - particularly towards the end where I determined similar high yield nodes on different paths should have the values of the node before them checked.,Thanks - very interesting. All the best with your research!,32
3,no plan,I only clicked on the ends and a different one then paid high the time before,the end of any row,when I felt it was high enough,no,no,to look at the end results,no,60
4,I didn't care so much about the inside nodes,I clicked on the end nodes,on the end nodes,when I found a value that was sufficient or revealed all the end nodes,I tried not clicking any nodes at first but started losing a lot of money,no,Its better to be certain of the end outcomes,No,42
5,My prediction,My Prediction,,My prediction,,,,nice,26
6,Based on previous clicks ,Best guess/process of elimination,Closest to the spider,When I had enough info to proceed,No,no,This game is a combination of luck and strategy,none,23
7,Based on how much negative numbers in row,Followed the green values,Each of the middle intersecting lines,When I saw a larger dollar amount,no,no,I'm not sure,no,57
8,I didn't click on a node closer to the beginning because those don't show much in the way of gains or losses,I clicked on a node at the end because those show the most gains or losses,"I mostly clicked on the same node, and I always clicked on a node at the end of the web",I always chose to click and view one of the nodes in each round,"I clicked on nodes at the end of the web so I could see where they'd lead me.  If they had any gains at all, I went for them.  If not, I went in the opposite direction.",no,"this game has a lot pf luck involved and even if it looks like one path is a good choice, I could be completely wrong.",fun HIT!,25
9,"If I saw a good positive spot before I had clicked everywhere, I just went with that.","At first I chose to click all spaces directly around me, to give as much information for the start as I could.  After a while I just didn't click.",Only the spaces directly around me.,"Once I was already down in the negative, I realized it didn't really matter anymore, since I was already going to lose a bunch.  I just didn't click and went where my gut took me, which rarely worked out.",Not really.,Nope.,"I'm bad at this, and the last spaces matter so much more than the first.",,30
10,"only clicked the highest potential to win/lose, ignored small wins/losses",random ,the end nodes,when i found what i thought was high paying,no,"the airplane tutorial was worse than the actual game, why do i have to wait a minute like some fucked up chinese torture minesweeper game ",nothing,nah ,20
11,None of the path space were worth clicking aka small numbers,Wanted the biggest numbers so I clicked toward the end.,At the ends of each path,I stopped clicking when I found a good number to make profit,Wanted the highest numbers!,No,"The ends of the paths had bigger amounts, I learned quick.",,21
12,If it led to certain amount of loss,I clicked where I thought I would get the most amount of money.,At the bottom left and right.,If I was going to lose more money than I gained,"I chose the ones closest to me and only opened a few nodes, if I found a decent paying one I went for it out right instead of spending more dollars",No,Go where the money is :),Thank you!,23
13,I tried to make a pattern where to click,I tried to do one pattern,The top part of the node,Every time the spider is at the end node,I tried to click on those nodes that gives more money. But I end up getting less when I go to just one route,none,I learn to explore and take risk,I really enjoyed the game. I always participate on your surveys/ studies I hope I can grab some more and explore more of this kind of game in the future!  ,28
14,random,random,top left,when i felt like i had reached the highest number in the web,tried to maximize the amount of moves in hopes that more green numbers would show up along the way,"no, it was pretty clear",I learned a little bit about my decision making,enjoyed the experiment!,33
15,I didn't clink on of the nodes along the route.,I click at the last node to see the best possible outcome with each route.,The last node nearest the start point.,When I reached an amount that I felt comfortable with.,I tried to minimize the numbers of nodes I had to pass through.,No,To minimize my losses.,No,39
16,I didn't bother backtracking from nodes with negative or small values.,I started at the ends and on finding a reasonably high value I worked my way back.,"On an end tile, often in the lower right for no particular reason. ",When I had a safe path to a decent node.,"I started just checking every possible end node, but I soon realized I would max out my bonus without doing so I settled for anything that would result in over about 30 gamebux so I'd have some extra in case I got surrounded by like -100 nodes or something. ",The bonus payment scheme was a bit confusing and I'm not sure I remembered it because that seems lower than I thought but w/e it's fine,I have no idea! ,"Nope, thanks! ",29
17,Random,Random,Center,Timer,Poor,No,Not to be an air traffic controller,None,65
18,I decided not to click in the middle nodes because it was costing too much to get to the end result,I clicked the last node of each area to know where the largest amounts were,in the lower left section,I stopped clicking when I found a range around $30 or more,I clicked the last nodes in each area despite it costing $1 each time because I usually regained that money back along the path.,no,It takes a risk to gain a higher reward,,43
19,I didn't click on the beginning steps because they were not worth it.,I clicked at the end points to see the biggest points.,At the end points of each line.,When I found a high score I felt was worth going.,That is all I could think of.,None.,That games are fun.,Thank you and have a great day!,30
20,Guessed and avoided areas of low end result,I guessed then went with highest overall,It varied,I guessed based on end value,no,no,Taking chances can be fun,,38
21,I tried to avoid things that seemed negative more often,I just randomly chose,up,When i couldn't go anymore,no,no,Things were not the same,,19
22,It almost never seemed to make too much of a difference what the values on the way to the endpoints were.,I needed to see on what value did each path end.,On the end of each path.,Once I'd decided what ending got the highest payout.,"No, that's it.",Nope.,I suppose that there must have been a better strategy. I could have made a lot more had I not been so cautious in clicking on every possible end.,,28
23,first stages,last ending points,the end points right side,once i found a high value,not really,no,go for the highest,none,26
24,i usually did not click the first step,i clicked on mostly end nodules,the end nodules,when I found a large enough green number at the end,went the route to the largest end nodule,no,I learned that I there was rarely a route without red numbers,no,60
25,where i would lose money,Random,random,when i came up with a decent positive amount,just the first node with a decent amount is when i stopped clicking,none,that nothing in life is free ,none,27
26,I didnt click on nods within the web ,I clicked at the ends of the web,the sides of the web,When I received a high number node,no ,no,games are fun when money is invovled ,,29
