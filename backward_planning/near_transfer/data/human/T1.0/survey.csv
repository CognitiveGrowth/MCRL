0,When the end payout was high enough to ignore the first sets of nodes.,"The pattern of higher payout at the last step revealed itself after the first few tries. I stuck with that strategy but, on the off chance that the pattern changed, I still checked the nodes on the first steps as well.",At the final (end) nodes.,When I felt confident of a decent payout to offset any deficits.,"Once a positive payout was determined, I ignored the other paths to keep costs of clicking down.",No.,Evaluate the final payout to determine if the first steps are worth the potential costs.,Thank you.,45
1,I did not click along the inside because i did think they mattere,I decided to click along the boarders because the end result was the most important numbr to me,I always started in the lower left hand corner for no particular reason.,I decided to stop clicking when i saw a really high number,,There was not anything confusing,I learned that sometimes the end result is less than what you thought it would be,,27
2,I only clicked on the end nodes because they had the best reward per click potential. Once I found a decent one I stopped clicking on others and went for it.,I looked at the end result for the nodes almost exclusively because I thought the end value would more than make up for any lost along the way and the cost of revealing,An end node on the left.,Once I found a sizable end node reward I stopped and went to it,I just tried to find out most of the end nodes and not worry about the losses getting to it.,No,how to do a cost benefit analysis very quickly,none,24
3,I didn't waste the $1 to reveal the nodes close to the center since they were all small positive or negative amounts. ,"I clicked the final steps to look for the higher nodes, the double checked the node before that one to ensure it wasn't a high deduction. ",The top outermost nodes.,When I found a path that was primarily all positive integers and a large dollar value node at the end. ,I wanted to try to find high value nodes early without spending too many $1 to display node values.,No,The value of spending a small amount of money to find a guaranteed paying larger path. ,,30
4,the closest nodes,on the end nodes,the end nodes,when i found a high score,i wanted to profit each turn.,no,that too much looking can make you lose oppurtunity.,,37
5,I didn;t click where I would lose the most money,I clicked when the node inspector found the most money,it changed,When I felt comfortable,I didn't have one,No ,Nothing,,19
6,too many negative numbers,it was random I guessed,I did not click ,I didn't,I went right ,nothing ,"not much, it seemed random",nope,24
7,I decided not to click on anything in the inside because the values were too small to matter in the long run.,I clicked on the outside circles first.,I just picked an outside bubble at random and went clockwise.,I stopped clicking when I got to an outside bubble that was greater than about ~40.,"That was pretty much it, I clicked clockwise around on the outside bubbles until I hit a number that was greater than ~40.",Everything made sense.,I learned to kind of fine tune my strategy as I went through the practice. The only thing I couldn't quite figure out was where the best place to start on the outside ring was. I sort of picked a starting spot randomly and went clockwise. I feel like that ended up costing me some money since there was no strategy to it.,This was a fun HIT! Best of luck with your research!,33
8,I avoided paths that ended with a large negative value.,I found the highest values on the final node in each path and took a chance that it would be the most profitable path overall.,I started clicking on the ending nodes on the left.,Mostly I found the path that ended with the highest value and stopped clicking when I found that path.,"About halfway through I decided that if I came across an ending node that was unusually high, like in the 90's, I would stop clicking then, but I never ran across another unusually high ending node after I made that decision.",Nothing confusing.,"I learned that in some instances, there probably was a more profitable path that didn't seem so at first glance.",This was a fun experiment. Thank you!,51
9,If there were a couple of red values on one branch then I assumed it wasn't a good path.,It seemed the end nodes had the highest values.,The end nodes. ,As soon as I found a high dollar amount.,Only that as soon as I found a really high dollar amount I figured my gains outweighed the risk of loss.,"I absolutely cannot computer things in my head -- there's probably a big gaming whole where my ""math brains"" should be! ","Not too take too many risks, that if something good showed up, go with it.",Nope! Thanks for an interesting HIT.,42
10,"never first step, since values were lower there","mostly last step, since values were higher there.",on one of the last steps,when likely highest or nearly highest value was uncovered,"briefly thought that the next to last step with the highest value indicated that the highest value final step was nearby, but abandoned that theory quickly.",no,the value of paying attention,none,49
11,the first few paths,the ends,end points,once a value was profitable to go the whole way,nothing else,no,focus on larger values,none,28
12,I just went by instinct.,I just went by instinct.,The beginning.,I just decided.,No.,No.,Nothing.,No.,37
13,I didn't.,Instinct,I just started where it did.. :?,When it ended duh?,No..,No,Spiders and airplanes,I enjoyed taking this survey,35
