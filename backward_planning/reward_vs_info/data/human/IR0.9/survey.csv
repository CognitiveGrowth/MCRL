3,"If the dollar amount of the last node was negative, I did not go that route.",I decided where to click based on the dollar amount of the last node.,I was more likely to click on the node that would lead to me going a shorter route.,I stopped clicking when I get a favorable amount.,,It was not confusing but it was hard to understand. I did not realize that I could reveal the amount under all the nodes.,I didn't learn anything from this experiment.,Fun experiment.,29

22,least expensive ones,expensive nodes first,farthest node,i clicked until i got +48,,,,,35
23,The first and second nodes were smaller values and had a smaller impact on the final earnings for the round.,Went to the furthest nodes as any negative amounts incurred along the way would be offset by any +48,Outer node.,When I revealed a +48 or a +24 if I had clicked many nodes before I figured out the optimal strategy.,It took me longer to figure out the optimal strategy than I would have liked.

29,I didn't really concentrate on the first nodes a lot because it wasn't worth losing a dollar. ,"Clicking was sort of random.

177,no,I did very bad,hard,when i was missing up,i was messing up,no,it is hard,,36
178,if there was a red on the first node I wasn't going to go in farther,I started at the left first node,first left node,when i found a good route,use as few clicks as possible to get the best path,no,that it was better to click and see the whole path than guess,,27
179,I didn't click on the first two nodes because they didn't matter due to the lack of value they could have had hidden.,I clicked only on the destination nodes since those held the most value.,The last node in each tree.,Once I revealed the node that was worth 48.,Find the green 48 in as few clicks as possible then head to it.,Everything was clear and straightforward.,I didn't learn anything that I could think of.,I felt it was impossible to make a $5 bonus halfway through since some rounds didn't have a green 48.,29
180,I didn't click on the others because they were for low amounts.,I only clicked on the end nodes.,On one of the end nodes.,When I found the green 48.,I just tried to find the green 48.,none,I don't know.,none,28
181,"I rarely clicked the middle nodes, as it wasn't worth it.",I clicked the outer nodes first every round.,The outer rim nodes.,"When I found a green 48, I usually took that route immediately.","If I found two green 48's, only then would I reveal the middle nodes.","Nope, the training session helped too.",Sometimes risky pathways were worth it.,,29
182,Based on my first click.,"First click is random, if it was good I would keep going otherwise I'd click somewhere else.",First one to the right,When I got a good enough outcome,,No,,,21
183,"The training phase taught me to speed up my reaction, to go straight to the final node",Click on the final nodes until I find a 48,group to my immediate left,when I saw a 48,"Very simple click on all the 48 nodes until I find a 48 then go there,if no 48 then go to the 24",Nothing,"Don't worry about the initial moves, focus on the final one",None,51
184,"Did not want to click on any node other than an end node, because it would not have been worth it.","I clicked on the end nodes randomly, hoping to find a $48.",Any end node at random,When I found a node with $48 or if I clicked on 3 or 4 end nodes and found no $48 but found a $24,"Nothing else, strategy was to guess until I found an end node with $48. Otherwise, it was everything I stated previously.",Nothing.,End nodes gave more money.,None.,23
185,Same as before randomly guessing,Random guess,Towards the left,When my funds got lower,I had not strategy just hoped I'd win money ,Trying to figure out some sort of system or logic behind picking certain amounts.,I am no good at this game.,,35
186,less money,looked at end points,it depends,got to highest point,no ,no,to use clicks,,31
187,didnt click on the closer nodes,randomly at the end nodes first,end nodes,when i felt i had enough information to move,just used gut feeling,no,nothing,,29
188,After spending to much in a few rounds on the inner nodes. ,I was clicking to many nodes on the smaller numbers,the closest nodes. ,When I was given penalties. ,It seemed like a better change to earn more If I found the highest outside number and went for it. ,It was hard to understand if there was a certain way to win. ,That I waste value trying to discern all paths. ,,27
189,I didn't click on a node that was on a path only to a negative end-result.,"I clicked on the end nodes, and then on the nodes between to maximum end result nodes.",On an end-node.,When the path to the maximum end result node was clear.,Not particularly.  Though I probably could have better honed it.  I accidentally pressed a key and missed an entire page of  the instructions.,"Not particularly, except that apparently, you can proceed by pressing a key other than space.  I believe I pressed a key on the keyboard (not the space bar) and it skipped past a page of the instructions before I was able to read them.","That it's better to have a plan, than to just proceed without one.",Nothing that I haven't already mentioned.,39
190,"if there were two final 48 nodes on the same path, the ones in between didn't matter","Last nodes first as they're worth the most, then based on where the 48s are, the paths to get there",end nodes,"when I knew where the 48s were, and if on different paths, the full paths to them","in the middle testing phase, I didn't click at all as the delay was annoying and it was just practice",,,I had to go through this twice... the whole HIT restarted on round 11 of the test block first goround,24
191,Based on relative judgment of where the spider would end.,Practice session informed me.,At the end of each node.,When all of the paths seemed sufficiently clear.,Simply clicked the end of each node and went backwards from the +$48s I had.,No.,It's better to mitigate risk than to it is to gamble.,None.,28
192,where i would lose the most,I found the spot with the most gains first,to the left side mostly,when I found the +48 spot,I just found the +48 and went there,nothing,That it is good to find the money first,na,29
193,I went to the path of the green 48,I checked for 48 at all the ends first,the outside edges,once i found the green 48,"no, thats it.",No.,"Nothing, really, just played the game","No, thank you!",39
194,I didn't click the closer nodes because they're not worth as much,I used the outer nodes to see where I should end up,the outer nodes,When I found the +48 nodes or clicked all the outer nodes,"No, I just clicked the more expensive outer nodes to start","No, pretty straightforward",How to problem solve,"No, thanks this was fun!",28
195,Based on my money,I chose not to click at all,First block,Based on my money,I didn't really have a strategy,No,Nothing,No,36
196,by guessing,by reveling node value,end nodes,when it reaches to end,No specific strategy ,No,not sure,,36
197,on negative amounts as much as possible.,just total guessing each time,Left or right,when I reached the end of the arrows,Stay away from the negative.,no,Patience as the screen made you wait.,,54
198,by chance,by luck/chance,i selected by random,once i seen a positive amount,,no,click the outside boxes to first instead of the inside boxes,,29
199,The 1st and second steps really didn't matter if $48 was an option.,"The final steps had the largest values, $48 buttons outweigh the possible minuses",Final Step bottom right,Once I found a $48 button I went for that,Find the $48 and then just go for it.,No,"I don't play to win, I play to not lose.","Solid game, I find it hard to imagine you can earn $5 as a bonus though.",24
200,Only the end nodes were worth the money.,I just clicked an end node until I found the best solution.,End nodes.,When I found 48 or the best solution.,That was it.,Nope,Not sure,None.,20
201,it was a feeling to try and click one and hope for the best,I tried going opposite but for me i couldn't figure out where to go,right hand side,after 2 negatives i went the opposite way,i don't think i had a strategy per say.,"i didn't quite get the testing part, i kept getting delayed",nothing i can think of,interesting task,27
202,I did not click in the direction of lower numbers,I wanted to maximize the total score by reaching a node with $48,First top step,When I have already found a path to $48,I was looking to maximize the total bonus by minimizing the number of clicks and maximizing the money on each step.,No,I learnt how to play this game.,no,45
203,would not click the route towards the goal if the goal was the best outcome,First click would be the goal or destination,far corners,When I found the best outcome,I hope I did it properly,"At first yes, at the end, well I don't know, If I made incorrect decisions, then I suppose yes.","That I was supposed to learn something, but I just now learned that",Have a nice day,46
