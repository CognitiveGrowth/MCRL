0,I could not tell where not to click,I just tried different directions,up,after I decided which direction I was going,no,yes,I do not like spiders!,none,44
1,tried to avoid the bad spaces,i don't like clicking because it spends a dollar ,at the first step,when I was satisfied ,,no,"sometimes you win, sometimes you lose ",,29
2,I calculated the path ,I used the node to help decide,the the left,When I seen the most positive path,I tried to notice a pattern but did not see on so I used the peek tool to help me,no,It would be real hard to get a 5 bonus,Thx for game,36
3,"I didn't want to waste clicks on the smaller value nodes, so I mostly clicked on the ending nodes.",I went for the +48. ,The ending nodes.,When I felt my choice was correct. ,No.,No,Patience and thoughtfulness,No,39
4,The middle tiles were unimportant to know about.,"After I discovered I could click on more than just the first tiles, I clicked on the last ones first to see the final amount.",Any of the final tiles were first for me to click on.,If I found a $48 I would mostly just head in that direction.,Sometimes I'd click on the first ones to see if some were better than others.,No.,"I learned after the first practice round I was able to click on any tile, not just adjacent ones.",NA,29
5,"I never clicked the first node, figured it wouldn't be worth it. The last node was the most important to spend my $1 on.","I decided to click on the second node, and then click on the third node after that. ","Start from left to right, on the second node","after i had 2 positive numbers, or the the 3rd node was 48",Save money sometimes by clicking on more nodes,"I didn't understand the delay at first in the trial, until I started to spend more of my $1 on finding more node amounts","To take your time sometimes, at least in the trial runs.",,24
6,would not click the route towards the goal if the goal was the best outcome,First click would be the goal or destination,far corners,When I found the best outcome,I hope I did it properly,"At first yes, at the end, well I don't know, If I made incorrect decisions, then I suppose yes.","That I was supposed to learn something, but I just now learned that",Have a nice day,46
