484	I clicked on two circles, if one of the two was green, then I proceeded to click a path to see which would provide more money. I didn't go down a negative path unless I absolutely had to. I tried to keep my choices to two total flight paths each. 	0	0	1	0	1	0

493	Found a positive route when possible using the first and last bubbles. If they were positive I took that route, the intermediary bubble never really mattered.	1	0	0	1	0	0

502	I tried to rule out the first step, then take a look at where the end of those routes earned. I did some math in my head to calculate the best I could do based on the maximum payout.	1	0	0	0	1	0

507	I tried to plan the route to avoid the big penalties. So if I saw a route with a -20 I would do the opposite without necessarily revealing it, with mixed results.	0	0	1	0	0	1
508	Honestly, I don't know.  It really was a process of trial and error.  I couldn't really identify any strategy that I could consistently use to be successful in this game.  I found it frustrating.	0	1	0	1	0	0

514	It was pretty pricey for me to try to figure out which way to go, so I tried to pick and choose what I want to find out, and then go from there.	1	0	0	1	0	0

519	I checked the 4 primary routes first (the first place you moved to), then of the 2 that appeared to pay the most, I then checked the 6 end points, and decided where to go based on that. This is the funnest HIT I've ever done, and I genuinely enjoyed it. Thank you!	1	0	0	0	1	0
