          help you learn how to make better decisions.</b> After each flight, if
          you did not plan optimally, a feedback message will apear. This message
          will tell you two things:

          1. Whether you observed too few relevant values or if you observed
             irrelevant values (values of locations that you cant fly to).
          2. Whether you flew along the best route given your current location and
             the information you had about the values of other locations.

          In the example below, not enough relevant values were observed, and
          as a result there is a 15 second timeout penalty. <b>The duration of
          the timeout penalty is proportional to how poorly you planned your
          route:</b> the more money you could have earned from observing more
          values and/or choosing a better route, the longer the delay. <b>If
          you perform optimally, no feedback will be shown and you can proceed
          immediately.</b> The example message here is not necessarily representative of the feedback you'll receive.

        In this game, you are in charge of flying an aircraft. As shown below,
        you will begin in the central location. The arrows show which actions
        are available in each location. Note that once you have made a move you
        cannot go back; you can only move forward along the arrows. There are
        eight possible final destinations labelled 1-8 in the image below. On
        your way there, you will visit two intermediate locations. <b>Every
        location you visit will add or subtract money to your account</b>, and
        your task is to earn as much money as possible. <b>To find out how much
        money you earn or lose in a location, you have to click on it.</b> You
        can uncover the value of as many or as few locations as you wish.

        #{img('task_images/Slide1.png')}

        To navigate the airplane, use the arrows (the example above is non-interactive).
        You can uncover the value of a location at any time. Click "Next" to proceed.

        You will play the game for #{N_TRIALS} rounds. The value of every location will
        change from each round to the next. At the begining of each round, the
        value of every location will be hidden, and you will only discover the
        value of the locations you click on. The example below shows the value
        of every location, just to give you an example of values you could see
        if you clicked on every location. <b>Every time you click a circle to
        observe its value, you pay a fee of #{fmtMoney PARAMS.info_cost}.</b>

        #{img('task_images/Slide2_' + costLevel + '.png')}

        Each time you move to a
        location, your profit will be adjusted. If you move to a location with
        a hidden value, your profit will still be adjusted according to the
        value of that location. #{do text.constantDelay}

        There are two more important things to understand:
        1. You must spend at least 45 seconds on each round. A countdown timer
           will show you how much more time you must spend on the round. You
           wonâ€™t be able to proceed to the next round before the countdown has
           finished, but you can take as much time as you like afterwards.
        2. </b>You will earn <u>real money</u> for your flights.</b> Specifically,
           one of the #{N_TRIALS} rounds will be chosen at random and you will receive 5%
           of your earnings in that round as a bonus payment.
