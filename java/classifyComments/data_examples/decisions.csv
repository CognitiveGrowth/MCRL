S600877	0	I chose routes that looked to be shortest.	
S795207	1	This was fun. Thanks+ACE- I tried to think about the probability that the red square would be in certain areas and went for that route. Sometimes I was wrong  and sometimes I was right.	
S826168	0	I based them off how many the average steps it would take to get to the red door.

S224593	1	One of the most interesting studies I have ever taken on mturk. Excellent game. I mostly used intuition and some logic here and there.	
S248332	1	I tried to gauge the path  to guess which way the door might be. I am not sure that this was such a great method  as it seemed to take me too many steps to get there.	
S266392	1	I just went where I wanted to go.	
S29058	0	This is so much fun. I was thinking that I would love to find this as a stand alone game somewhere on the Internet. It is a little bit mindless which makes it nice. Thanks+ACE- At first  it was just random. Then  I SEEM to notice that if I go either left or up  that the red square is in a direction that is against my initial wish to move in another direction. ummm...does this make sense? I had just begun to test my theory and it was working a bit.	
S294201	0	I went with my gut.	
S304108	1	It was a fun task. Unique from most mturk ones+ACE- I went with my gut feeling and hoped for the best.	
S336295	1	Just guessing.	
S34222	1	great game i tried to make a rational choice but it always seemed random	
S359778	0	I went with my gut.	
S37550	1	Fun+ACE- It's random. It's a guessing game. Sometimes I go far  sometimes I go near. It's luck. There are routes that can reveal the most squares faster though and I try to take those.	
S394005	0	I just guessed.	
S490917	0	Mostly guessing and with some feeling that I should go in one direction more than the other.	
S49292	0	I just went with my gut  there was no way to know.	
S586692	0	I loved this game. I guessed which way was probably the best way to go.	
S622759	0	Randomly	
S625801	1	I just went with what felt right to me.	
S662810	0	At first i decided to check the last place i thought it would be but that seemed to be wrong almost every time. Then i tried to check the first place id think it would be and it was right more often.	
S673562	1	there is a lot of guessing here i tried to be as efficient as possible but a lot of times I had to guess	
S701323	1	I used intuition to try to pick the correct path to go  but sometimes I just logically tried to clear nearest black squares first just in case the red square was nearest to the starting location.	
S722906	0	Just guessed	
S737098	0	I have always felt my best guess was pretty good not so today. I had to take a lot of steps.I tried to make my best guess as to which way to go.	
S748157	0	was quite a bit about luck+ACE- It seemed like the red square was placed in inconvenient locations  so I tried them first.	
S76694	1	On of my favorite hits I've done so far,  thank you It was mostly gut feeling also the a little bit of the quickest way to uncover the most black squares.	
S771420	0	I went with my gut instinct	
S776069	0	This was fun I figured the exit was the farthest away	
S781012	0	Fun game. Just relied on a gut feeling no real way to tell which direction was the correct one.	
S78642	0	Fun but frustrating. Gut instinct	
S847253	1	This was really alot of fun. I hope you have more of these available in the future. I just guessed a square of where I thought the exit may be and tried to get there in the shortest amount of moves	
S952115	0	I knew the red square could be anywhere so I just took my best guess and went with my gut instinct.	
S976844	0	That was fun. I really enjoyed it. I just took some guesses	
S983016	1	I tried to uncover as many of the black boxes with as little movement as possible.  After that I just kind of guessed where I thought it might be.	
S983809	1	Intuition	
S989739	0	Thanks for being a requester on Mturk+ACE- I really didn't make a choice. I just chose a side and random and hoped it worked out.	
S990120	0	I just kind of went randomly down the mazes and guessed which direction the red square would be.	
S994778	0	Good game, no problems. I took my best guess.	
S11135	1	Mostly random I guess. I just followed wherever the black squares were. Tried to cover the entire area and not skip any black spots and go in order. Tried to cover every single black space before moving on. Tried to not back track at all as much as possible	
S717976	1	By think which way have less step to take	
S748661	1	This was a ton of fun. I went the way that had the most possibility of having a red.	
S932984	0	I tried to look for options first that would need the least moves to get there.	
S112685	0	I tried to go to the closest spots with the most black squares	
S126242	0	I tried to go for the space with the most amount of hidden boxes first so that I could clear the most area as quickly as possible.	
S16432	1	I tried to minimize the expected number of steps.	
S164546	1	I tried to see the areas that were closer to me first and then continued to the further away areas.	
S180888	0	At first I picked randomly  but then I changed my strategy and decided to instead investigate the closest squares first in case the red square was there.	
S235282	0	Since the exit was equally likely to be behind any of the black squares  I tried to clear them as efficiently as possible.	
S247056	1	Everything worked,  it was fun,  thanks. Just went by what I thought would expose the most blocks to try to uncover the exit faster.	optmetric
S250296	0	This really was a fun game. Thanks+ACE- It's nice to work on a fun HIT once in a while I tried to take the shortest path that would clear the black squares most at a time in order to get to the red square the quickest.	0.7766990291
S256137	1	 Interesting task. I tried to look at the map and take the route that would be the less moves first  and if that did not work then move on to the other parts.	0.8333333333
S265716	0	Getting more black squared cleared with the fewest amount of steps	0.8244680851
S293561	1	This is one of the more fun HITs I've worked on. A sincere Thank You for the work. I tried to make sure that any square I moved into would give me the most encompassing view of adjacent or 'distant' squares. +AFs- If that makes any sense. :) +AF0-	0.7314814815
S294423	1	Thanks+ACE- I picked areas that had the most black squares that would be opened at a time.	0.7692307692
S299693	1	I went to the area with the most black squares because odds would be better if random	0.893258427
S311128	1	I tried to think of the most efficient way to examine as much area as possible.	0.9030612245
S337973	1	 This is a fun game+ACE- I tried to uncover the most squares with the least moves since probability states the exit will be in a place with the most squares.	0.8611111111
S342386	0	 I liked this. I went toward the direction of more black squares since each square has an equal chance of having the exit.	0.797029703
S34564	1	I tried to reveal as many blocks as possible with as few moves as I could.	0.8020833333
S355417	0	I tried to check the shortest paths first	0.8815789474
S365730	1	Very fun survey. It keeps you attention. I tried to uncover all the black squares that were closet to me so I wouldn't have to back track. Also  when a path split into 2 directions I chose the path with the most black squares.	0.875
S368470	0	Found this fun and interesting. I would go towards the area with most black doors since i figured that would increase my chances of having an exit	0.8385416667
S391243	0	 I loved this survey very much+ACE- I based my decisions on which would clear the most blocks in the shortest amount of moves.  I tried to stick to that.	0.8221153846
S402333	1	 It didn't seem like the exit was truly random or equally likely to be behind any of the black squares. It was usually if not always tucked away at the end of a row or in a corner. It never seemed to be behind one of the first few black squares or on a main path. I tried to go the direction that would make the most black squares become visible where the exit was most likely to be based on the number of black squares in that area. I generally checked black areas I was near first before going further.	0.8762886598
S411804	0	I enjoyed this game. Thank you for allowing me to participate. At first  I just moved toward the black squares. Then I tried to move toward the squares that would uncover more black squares at one time.	0.7587719298
S414838	1	Where I could uncover the most (see) at once.	0.7570093458
S419107	0	Tried to reveal as many black squares as possible and go from there.	0.8031914894
S421809	1	tried to play the best odds+ADs- chose routes that would expose the most squares and I did not want to have to backtrack and waste moves so I explored each section as it came for the most part.	0.7717391304
S482085	1	Thanks it was fun I tried to maximize the number of black squares I'd reveal with each move. I would make sure my path would reveal all black squares along the way  since every black square (supposedly) had an equal chance to be the exit.	0.7766990291
S505076	0	 I decided to choose the past +AC0- firstly at least +AC0- with the most black blocks.	0.9193548387
S524015	0	This was quite fun. Thanks+ACE- I tried to prioritize unveiling the areas closest to me first. This strategy did not work out well at all+ACE-	0.8155339806
S566478	0	Tried to find the quickest route with the least steps. Tried to keep turning the same direction.	0.8947368421
S582832	1	It was really fun. I tried to reveal the most squares in the fewest amount of steps.	0.9030612245
S607333	1	The closest black box	0.7932692308
S649302	1	I tried to figure out the most efficient way to uncover most of the boxes. When faced with a decision between two ways to go I assumed that the door had an equal probability of being in each box and first went in a way which would uncover more boxes.	0.7745098039
S653044	1	This would actually make a fun strategy game if it were available outside of the study. Generally by the least steps to uncover the most black squares	0.8010204082
S658956	1	tried to reveal as much as possible without having to backtrack. I would reveal the largest amount of blocks in the fewest steps possible as long as it didn't mean I would have to backtrack.	0.8368421053
S702215	1	I enjoyed this+ACE- I tried to get the most bang for my buck.  In other words go where there was more black squares if it was close enough.  Sometimes though it was more efficient to just hit some of the lesser areas just in case as it would not have been good to have to back track.	0.8203883495
S713325	1	I tried to see the most with the fewest moves.	0.7912087912
S74893	0	I tried to go to where more blocks would open up	0.8269230769
S75262	1	I went where the most black blocks were.	0.7061403509
S769114	1	This was actually quite fun. I'd try to clear as many black squares as I could in as few moves as possible to try to ascertain the position of the red square.	0.8365384615
S773407	0	 This was interesting. I took routes that would allow me to reveal as many black blocks as possible in the least amount of steps.	0.8112244898
S818256	0	I cleared out as much black area as possible at first so that I would not have to go back and check areas that were not cleared (at least not as much).	0.8181818182
S852951	1	I just tried to go to areas where I could uncover the most black squares at the same time.	0.9352941176
S882638	1	tried to view as many black spots with my movements so i could see if the exit was there	0.8352272727
S890803	1	I tried to check the closest spots first and go from their	0.8
S898785	0	fun game I enjoyed it. I thought about the best path to take and how I could rule out as many spots as possible.	0.8130841121
S913867	0	Fun+ACE- Tried to go to the closest routes first.	0.7714285714
S94248	1	Thanks. I tried to uncover as many black spaces as I could with as few clicks as possible but it didn't always work.	0.9388888889
S97579	1	Interesting study+ACE- I tried to find the route that would get rid of as many black square in as few steps as possible	0.8736263736
