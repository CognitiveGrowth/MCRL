4	0	I like trying new things and this sounds exciting
5	0	I like trying new things and it sounds like fun.
6	0	I made this decision because being an alien race they must be much more advanced than us giving me no reason to not believe their claims. Also just being able to experience something out of this world would be good. 
7	0	The rational side of me is telling me to do situation B, but I'm extremely curious was situation A would lead to.
8	0	I'm really curious as to what this procedure is. I really like chocolate ice cream so I am very intrigued.
9	0	I like new things and change.. The other decision was known foods.. how boring
10	0	I like trying new things.
11	0	I want to try something new.
12	0	I would want to be scanned by this alien technology and see if they are correct.
13	0	I'm always down for trying new things
14	0	I decided to try them because they are described as pleasurable and unlike anything I have tried. I am therefore curious.
15	0	I would be really interested in trying something new and different.  This procedure sounds like both.
16	0	Because if it's as good as chocolate ice cream, but not chocolate ice cream, I'm curious to the experience!
17	0	I wanted to try something new. 
18	0	I based my decision off the fact that the Alien procedures were as pleasurable as eating ice-cream, so I went for something new and exciting.
19	1	I dislike the uncertainty and prefer something familiar.
20	1	"I don't trust the aliens! No, sir! Not one bit! How do THEY know what I am going to like? Their ""brain scans""? If the aliens are so smart what do they need to scan my brain for? I'm sick of aliens telling us what we will or won't like. "
21	1	I think I would be more comfortable.
22	1	Because it said that the alien procedures were pleasurable but nothing like eating vanilla or chocolate ice cream.  I wanted to stick with something I knew as opposed to something that was unknown, even though it was supposed to be pleasurable.  
23	1	I wouldn't want to do the procedures because I have no idea what they actually are. What if they have miscalculated how much I would like them, and they in fact are horrible procedures? I would much rather just eat ice cream.
24	1	I would rather stick with the safer, known option. I don't think I should trust the aliens. 
25	1	I would be scared that the alien procedures would cause some long term effects to my body.  I would also be scared that the alien procedure could go wrong and not work.
26	1	it is more familiar
27	1	Don't trust aliens
28	1	We have no idea what the aliens know about how people feel
29	1	I would like to be safe than sorry
30	1	I have no idea what the alien procedures might be but I am curious. In the end though i thought it would be better to stick with something I know.
31	1	I would prefer to be safe and go with something I know.  Something as unknown as the alien procedures is a little too far out of my comfort zone.
32	1	They said I have to choose one,  I would choose situation b, because it is known to me
33	1	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCEDURES INVOLVE. THEY MAY BE JUST AS PLEASURABLE, BUT COULD IN ADDITION BE RISKY, UNHEALTHY, DANGEWROUS, ETC. I KNOW ICE CREAM TO BE SAFE
34	1	I would feel anxious about being put into a situation where I had to deal with unknown procedures.
35	1	I went with their analogy of favoring one ice cream flavor. 
36	1	I rather be in a situation with stuff I already know like known foods. 
37	1	I prefer to stick with thinga that I am already familiar with. I do not like taking risks.
38	1	I would not want to be poisoned, even if it is by accident. Things from other worlds may use ingredients that are not good for humans.
39	1	I know what it is and that i'll like it
40	1	I definitely prefer ice cream as an experience known
41	1	IT COULD BE A WEIRD WAY TO DO THINGS
42	1	I will know what exactly the procedure is
43	1	I want something that is familiar. I know what to expect
44	1	I'm familiar with ice cream
45	1	I don't know the alien concept of pleasure, or whether I should trust them. I would rather stick to something I know than try some completely unknown 'procedure.'
