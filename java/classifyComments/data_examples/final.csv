0	I looked at a few circles and made educational guesses.	0	1	0
1	I tried to show just enough location prizes to see if I was going to lose/win a lot of money	1	0	0
2	I tried different methods none seemed to work well.	2	2	1
3	I tried the nearest locations first because if the a near location was heavy negative then I think it was worth the risk of spending more for revealing other locations. Once I found a profitable near location I would look at the location after it, and if the that second location was profitable then I would invest +ACQ-2 to find both of the ending locations.	1	1	0
4	Tried to follow the paths with the most positive amounts. Once I found a path with the most positives and least negatives, I stopped clicking and started moving.	2	1	0
5	i didn't plan at all in the first few rounds, but then tried to find the destinations with the biggest payouts and least deductions on the routes	1	0	0
6	Just picked random spots	1	1	0
7	totally random	1	2	1
8	I like to have options so I tried to reveal as many as I could without spending to much. Then I took the routes that were most profitable.	0	2	1
9	i found a profitable route and took it	1	0	0
10	I just picked a direction	1	2	1
11	tried to find the best route thta paid the most	2	1	0
12	I just kinda picked one	0	1	0
13	I started checking the endpoints and worked backwards when I found a favorable ending	2	0	0
14	tried to guess where the money was	0	2	1
15	I tried to go different routes everytime	2	2	1
16	I didn't do much planning I just kind of took my chances.	0	0	0
17	First I priced the destinations, and then I tried to choose the most beneficial route.	2	0	0
18	I randomly picked a route	0	0	0
19	I started with the first decision, if one was more, I then checked the third decision, since the second has no choice. If two were the same, then I checked the second and sometimes the third to decide.	2	0	0
20	Random	1	2	1
21	I'd just click the middle icons first to get a feel for which path was good, then would go from there. 	2	1	0
22	random	0	0	0
23	I just clicked the highest paying ones.	2	0	0
24	No plan. You made it frankly impossible to plan with any sense of accuracy or real hope of gaining a bonus, and I pretty much gave up trying once I realized that.	1	2	1
25	I tried to not spend that much money if I could find a paying route right in the beginning.	0	1	0
27	try to guess my best	0	2	1
28	My plan at first was to fly randomly without spending much money, but then i realized it's better to spend it figuring out the path.	0	0	0
29	I tried different strategies.  Focusing on the destination and also focusing on the through ways.  	0	2	1
31	I picked a circle closest to the plane first and if it was a positive number I checked the following circles to see if they were also positive amounts of money.	2	1	0
32	I tried to see if the first stop was going to cause a big penalty. If the first stop was costly, I tried another path.	1	1	0
34	I opened as many as I felt I needed to in order to find a good path, stopped when I found one that paid well	2	0	0
35	If the path had been a bad one...then I decided to try it again figuring the path wouldn't repeat	0	1	0
36	I checked the values of the end points to see which ones brought more money. I was looking for circles that gave +ACQ-20	1	1	0
37	I tried to avoid moving to spaces with losses.	1	0	0
38	I just tried to make the most money that I could	2	0	0
40	I didn't really understand how to plan the route. I just tried to try a different route	0	1	0
41	I didn't	0	2	1
42	I tried to peek at the second spot over, and tried to stick with the route that used the highest value in those spots.	1	0	0
43	Tried to know everything.	2	1	0
44	learned to determine if the first spot, then later ones were profitable.	1	1	0
45	This was really fun. I got to decide how to pay some money to prevent myself from losing money. It's almost like buying insurance. 	2	0	0
46	look for a large number and head for it	0	1	0
47	Randomly	1	2	1
48	I just tried a different route each time for the airplane.	0	1	0
49	I started with the routes closest until i got a positive and then checked ones further out.	2	1	0
51	I uncovered all of the values (cost of +ACQ-4), then chose the route with the highest payment (usually more than +ACQ-4).	2	0	0
52	what made sense so a hunch	0	2	1
53	I tried to find the path that I didn't lose out on.  If it was positive, I went with it instead of looking more.	1	1	0
54	I checked the first circle on each route, and just went with the one that had the best payout.  I figured checking all the circles would prove too expensive, so I thought it bets to start out stroingly as possible and hope for the best after that.	1	1	0
55	Poorly	1	2	1
56	I just kind of picked one. No real plan.	2	2	1
57	I clicked to see the value of each circle and chose the highest value, then chose randomly.	1	1	0
58	In the beginning I determined that the penalty for learning the hidden values was low, so I didn't mind selecting them.  I	1	0	0
59	I just did the same thing over and over.	2	2	1
61	trying not to be influenced by previous reward or deduction	2	2	1
62	Usually the first leg less 	2	0	0
63	I would check the final destinations first looking for green, then work backward and calculate. If I found a good one quickly I would go for it, otherwise I kept clicking until I found something.	1	1	0
64	just tried to find the most profitable route	1	0	0
65	I would check the first stop and find a positive dollar amount and then I would click on the last stop along that route to find another positive amount. I tried not to click more than three times. 	2	2	1
66	I tried to plan things, but it didn't work out very well.  	1	2	1
67	I mostly just chose randomly. Once in awhile I would duplicate the pattern twice in a row, but mostly tried to rotate through the options.	0	1	0
69	I randomly picked a route every time.	0	0	0
70	I had good luck with going north, so I went that direction.	2	2	1
71	Try to find the best paying bubble directly connected to my departure spot, then select the next bubble from the best paying bubble and proceed out the best paying combined branch.	2	1	0
72	I would try to look for profit amounts then plan route.	0	0	0
73	I checked the value of all the destination points first, then the intermediate points to determine the best outcome	1	0	0
74	there was no good way	1	2	1
75	I first checked to see if there were any very profitable routes immediately surrounding my starting position, If there were any +//0- or +//0- routes nearby, I would explore those.	2	1	0
76	first at random, then for highest value	0	0	0
77	none	0	2	1
78	Random choice	0	0	0
80	At first I thought I would click anywhere but once I saw the penalties I decided to click on the end routes in a clockwise fashion.	1	0	0
82	The routes that worked before for good payouts.	0	0	0
83	I guessed	0	1	0
84	At first I picked several random circles and looked at their values. That ended up costing more than I could make up for. Then I tried picking routes without looking +AC0ALQ- that failed too, Then I tried looking at one or two first steps, that didn+ADs-t work well either.	1	2	1
85	Checked a far circle in each of the sectors until I found a positive value.	2	2	1
86	I started by looking at all possibilities, then realized it was difficult to retrieve the losses.	1	1	0
87	I figured I could only afford to lose +ACQ-8 (2 hints) for each round.	0	2	1
88	no specific route...just moved 	0	1	0
89	I took the route each time that had given me positive results in the past	2	2	1
90	i checked the intersection of each route first, then checked the sides connected to the positive ones	2	0	0
92	went with higher numbers	2	1	0
93	just went with my gut	0	1	0
94	The first profitable route i found i took	2	1	0
95	I tried to reveal at least one route and if the first one was negative I avoided that branch	2	2	1
96	By chance	0	0	0
97	I found values of all possible end points. Eventually I also found values of the routes that went to the highest end point values.	0	1	0
98	I tried to make the most money, or at least not lose too much. I started in and worked my way out.	2	1	0
99	I went with my gut	0	0	0
100	pretty much random+ADs- spending +ACQ-4 for each look didn't seem to help much	1	2	1
101	I chose to show a few spots, searching for a positive number instead of negative. once I found a good route I went that way, without looking for a more profitable way.	1	0	0
102	I have no freaking clue I wasted all my money	0	2	1
103	In the beginning, I viewed the first stop to look for the highest paid, and then the next stops to avoid losing money.  didn't work all that well +AC0- inconsistent.  At the end, I tried some random paths +AC0- seemed to work better. 	0	2	1
104	Trial and error.	0	2	1
105	I tried to expose the route with the highest payout, then progressed where I'd just reveal the first 4 legs and took a gamble.	1	1	0
