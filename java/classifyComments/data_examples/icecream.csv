26	1	suspicious	I am afraid of the alien foods.
24	0		i thought about what was better
41	0	novelty	I choose the alien food because what are the chances that I''d ever get a chance to try alien food again. Also chose their suggestion because hey it''s their food  they should know about it more than me. '
32	0	novelty	Curiosity would get the better of me. I like trying new things as well.
53	1	suspicious	I dislike the uncertainty and prefer something familiar.
60	1	suspicious	"I don''t trust the aliens! No, sir! Not one bit! How do THEY know what I am going to like? Their ""brain scans""? If the aliens are so smart what do they need to scan my brain for? I''m sick of aliens telling us what we will or won''t like. '"
28	0	why_not	Well I enjoy chocolate icecream and if I get the same level of enjoyment out of that by trying Chanp I don''t see why I wouldn''t try it.'
32	1	suspicious	I think I would be more comfortable.
33	1	suspicious	I''m not a very adventurous eater.  There are certain foods that I absolutely despise.  I''m also very affected by food''s visual appearance  and I won''t eat food that I think looks funny.  For these reasons  I''m not interested in anything new. '
33	1	suspicious	I like to know what I eat. Alien food could be as good as chocolate ice cream but I could be eating for example aliens poop.
33	1	suspicious	I do not like the uncertainty of the alien foods
57	1	pref_familliar	Because it said that the alien procedures were pleasurable but nothing like eating vanilla or chocolate ice cream.  I wanted to stick with something I knew as opposed to something that was unknown even though it was supposed to be pleasurable.  
31	0	why_not	I prefer the taste of Vanilla over chocolate  so if I trust their judgement I will prefer Vamp
31	0	novelty	At first I was afraid I''d be eating human and that almost scared me away from trying it  but I like to try new things so I chose to eat the alien food'
33	1	suspicious	I would rather eat something I am comfortable I guess.
26	1	suspicious	I don''t want to try weird new foods'
26	1	pref_familliar	I made the decision to eat known food because its something I would be able to relate to.
55	0	novelty	I decided to taste the food because I like anything chocolate and am willing to try anything for the first time. 
40	1	suspicious	I was going to choose the alien food at first but then I thought about it and I began to think about what if the aliens are wrong and the food would poison me or I wouldn''t like. I decided to go with a known known instead of a known unknown (Thank you Donald Rumsfeld)'
26	0	novelty	I would like to try new foods
31	1	suspicious	I wouldn''t want to do the procedures because I have no idea what they actually are. What if they have miscalculated how much I would like them  and they in fact are horrible procedures? I would much rather just eat ice cream.'
30	1	suspicious	I would rather stick with the safer  known option. I don''t think I should trust the aliens. '
24	1	suspicious	I would be scared that the alien procedures would cause some long term effects to my body.  I would also be scared that the alien procedure could go wrong and not work.
21	1	suspicious	it is more familiar
36	1		I am not in the mood to try an alien food.
31	1	suspicious	"I am apprehensive about trying something completely new.  Although the aliens have assured me that I will like these new foods, I am not a particularly adventurous eater and would be concerned that this food''s potentially different qualities may end up unappealing to me after all.  Therefore, I would ""play it safe"" and stick to what I know for certain I would already like.'"
29	0	novelty	I would try the foods because I know I will like them and it would be more fun to try a new and novel food than something I have had many times before.  I see no reason not to participate.
24	0	novelty	I am intrigued by the opportunity to try something completely new  as long as the experience is positive 
55	0	novelty	It would be fun to try something new
30	1	suspicious	I don''t want to eat anything weird; I''d rather eat something I''m familiar with. '
32	1	suspicious	Don''t trust aliens'
29	0	novelty	I like trying new things and this sounds exciting
63	1	suspicious	If I am going to put something in my mouth I want to know what it is.
52	0	novelty	since the aliens told me my enjoyment would be the same  I thought that there would be no risk in trying something I was unfamiliar with.
26	0	novelty	I want to try something very different
24	0	novelty	I like trying new things and it sounds like fun.
24	0	novelty	I made this decision because being an alien race they must be much more advanced than us giving me no reason to not believe their claims. Also just being able to experience something out of this world would be good. 
25	1	suspicious	We have no idea what the aliens know about how people feel
24	1	suspicious	I would like to be safe than sorry
26	1	why_not	I didn''t have any specific reason they are both pretty equivlant'
29	0	why_not	They are aliens and I am not afraid.
26	0	novelty	The rational side of me is telling me to do situation B but I''m extremely curious was situation A would lead to.'
25	1	pref_familliar	It''s something that I know I will like'
27	1		I have no idea what the alien procedures might be but I am curious. In the end though i thought it would be better to stick with something I know.
28	1		I prefer to go with what i already know  since the foods taste like nothing i have ever had before i dont want to find out.
26	0		I wanted to go try the alien food
30	0		If I would have a similar reaction as to eating ice cream I do enjoy I would take the chance of trying something new.
32	1		I would prefer to be safe and go with something I know.  Something as unknown as the alien procedures is a little too far out of my comfort zone.
53	1		They said I have to choose one   I would choose situation b  because it is known to me
28	1		I avoid taking risks and trying out new things. I simply prefer to be in the know of what I will eat and avoid unwanted surprises.
61	1		I DON''T KNOW WHAT THE PROCEDURES INVOLVE. THEY MAY BE JUST AS PLEASURABLE  BUT COULD IN ADDITION BE RISKY  UNHEALTHY  DANGEWROUS  ETC. I KNOW ICE CREAM TO BE SAFE'
53	1		For me  the choice was easy because I have a lot of bad reactions to various common foods and medicines.  Usually I won''t try anything new  even if it''s from Earth  and I certainly would never try an alien food  at least until millions of other people had tried it.  '
33	0		I could have an experience that nobody ever had before.
25	1		I would feel anxious about being put into a situation where I had to deal with unknown procedures.
23	0		I think it would be interesting to try new foods that no one else can. I already know that I like chocolate ice cream  so I would like to try something else that they think I would like.
21	0		I''m really curious as to what this procedure is. I really like chocolate ice cream so I am very intrigued.'
32	0		I like new things and change.. The other decision was known foods.. how boring
26	1		I like what I know
29	1		I went with their analogy of favoring one ice cream flavor. 
29	1		Because I know for sure that I like ice cream and although I would like the new foods just as much  I know they don''t taste like ice cream. My reasoning sounds very strange...'
35	0		I assumed they would not be dangerous  and who would refuse tasting alien food?  
47	0		I like to try new things
25	1		I rather be in a situation with stuff I already know like known foods. 
44	0		I would want to try something different. I know what our ice cream tastes like  The alien foods mentioned  I have never tried before.
21	1		I prefer to stick with thinga that I am already familiar with. I do not like taking risks.
25	0		I like trying new things.
39	0		I want to try something new.
22	1		I would not want to be poisoned  even if it is by accident. Things from other worlds may use ingredients that are not good for humans.
20	1		I know what it is and that i''ll like it'
67	1		Aliens lie
28	0		It sounds fun and exciting
29	0		How often do you get to try an alien food? whereas you get to eat that ice cream every day.  
35	0		When are you going to get another chance to try alien food?
27	0		I would want to be scanned by this alien technology and see if they are correct.
32	0		Vamp would let me get a basis for the most general type of the provided food
29	0		I''m always down for trying new things'
28	0		I decided to try them because they are described as pleasurable and unlike anything I have tried. I am therefore curious.
37	1		I would rather eat something that is from earth rather than try an alien food because I would be unsure of the ingredients in it.
35	0		I like trying new foods  and I''ve had chocolate and vanilla ice cream a plenty  so I''d be curious finding out what alien foods taste like. Who knows  I might like it. Plus  if I hate it  I can say at least I tried it :)'
34	1		I definitely prefer ice cream as an experience known
31	0		I like trying new food and am not generally a picky eater. I don''t love vanilla ice cream  but I do enjoy it and get pleasure from eating it  so I would feel confident that I would enjoy whatever Vanp was. '
23	1		I''m not too much into trying new unusual foods. I have no idea how an alien food would affect my body'
19	1		IT COULD BE A WEIRD WAY TO DO THINGS
25	1		I will know what exactly the procedure is
26	0		It might be interesting to try something so new and different. Presuming the foods are safe to eat  it could be an interesting experience. 
33	0		I would be really interested in trying something new and different.  This procedure sounds like both.
26	1		I want something that is familiar. I know what to expect
35	0		I am always looking to try something new
23	0		Because if it''s as good as chocolate ice cream  but not chocolate ice cream  I''m curious to the experience!'
60	1		I do not know what is in the alien foods if there is a drug or maybe it will harm or kill me.
39	0		Because it would be fun to experience something I haven''t before. '
44	0		Try anything once
32	0		It''d be interesting. It''s alien food for Christ''s sake! '
29	0		I wanted to try something new. 
29	0		It''s new and exciting. Plus I''d sneak some back and be famous.'
41	1		I do not like to try new strange foods 
22	1		I''m familiar with ice cream'
28	1		I don''t know the alien concept of pleasure  or whether I should trust them. I would rather stick to something I know than try some completely unknown ''procedure.'''
30	0		I like new experiences
32	0		I think it would be a unique experience to try alien food.  Don''t think I would want to pass up on that opportunity.  Try something new that will give me pleasure like chocolate ice cream does.  Sounds good to me.'
30	0		I based my decision off the fact that the Alien procedures were as pleasurable as eating ice-cream  so I went for something new and exciting.
